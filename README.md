I'm a high school software engineer who spends my time learning new technologies and grow my experience and knowledge in the computer science field. I try to work on challenging projects that reflect/improve my skills but occasionally indulge in projects that are simple, useful, or fun to make. I use technologies such as Javascript/NodeJS and Python to build amazing things. I hope to become more involved in the tech community and gain more programming skills as I grow and graduate high school.
