## About Me
- ✍🏻 I'm working on: Various projects! Checkout my profile.
- 🏫 I'm currently learning: Python and other technologies.
- 👥 I'm looking to collaborate with: Anyone who wants to learn with me!
- 🇩🇪 Fun Fact: I'm learning German.

I'm a high school student and software engineer who spends his time learning new technologies and growing his programming experience. I try to work on challenging projects that reflect/improve my skills but occasionally indulge in projects that are simple, useful, or fun to make. I use technologies such as Javascript/NodeJS and Python to build amazing things. I hope to become more involved in the tech community and gain more programming skills as I grow and graduate high school.
